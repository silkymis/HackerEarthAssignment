Now coming to the iPhone X. I will be speaking only about the phone and it\u2019s features and not compare with other models.Pros-- Its  truly a beautiful phone. The notch in the top is something I feel u will want to have once u start using it.- the build quality is amazing. It\u2019s a premium phone from the get go. Once u open the box, it\u2019s like opening a Pandora\u2019s box, something truly befitting a flagship.(of course it\u2019s an year old now)- the screen resolution is just crisp and jaw dropping. Unlike its predecessors, the screen is gorgeous. Colours are spot on, the True Tone display needs some time to get used to but later there\u2019s no turning back to the normal mode. The colours, no matter the time of the day, sunlight , no light, moonlight, tube light or what ever, always great.-the camera is very good being a dual camera and all and the pictures are pretty good, although I am not a avid mobile photographer.-the size of the phone is just right. At least for me it seems a good fit. Although sometimes 2 hands are required for some tasks but overall one handed most of the time.- Face ID- this is where it gets tricky. The phone unlocks with Face ID or a passcode. Now I have tried this feature with a beard , dim lighting , night times and many possible scenarios, and I must say , it\u2019s good. Although it\u2019s takes a few milliseconds more in low lighting, but over all good. (PS NOTE- there is no finger print unlock !!!!!!!)- The phone is truly fast. Multitasking, heavy gaming, anything is like a walk in the park for the phone. It\u2019s truly a beast with it processing speed. Doesn\u2019t warm up even when doing multiple tasks or playing PUBG. You have to understand that apple uses its RAM in a different way, so 3gb RAM may seem little on paper but don\u2019t let numbers fool you.Cons-- battery life - now the battery life for the average usage is good but for gaming and heavy usage I feel is a bit disappointing. Could have been better, but hey, that\u2019s what power banks are there for.- headphone jack- this is truly frustrating sometimes!!!! I mean come on!!!!! Who will manufacture Bose or sony  or beats headphones with a lighting cable!!!!!!!!
