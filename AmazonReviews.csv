Amazon Customer,2018-10-31, Silver , 256GB,True,1.0,Amazon Return support is too poor,"I purchased iphone X on 26th Oct'18 and started using from 28th Oct'18. When i received the product, it was already opened which i informed Amazon representative but i was told that it is original product and it will not have issue. Within two days, it started giving me issue with network & WiFi connectivity. I again contacted Amazon through app but i was directed to Apple support. After talking to Apple representative, i only got indefinite answer like it could be software issue and i should wait till it updates but Amazon return/replace policy valid for only 10 days. After purchasing a phone worth up to 90k, i had to do all this and still no support from Amazon."
ShowrobDa,2018-10-12, Space Grey , 64GB,True,5.0,"An amazing deal at INR 69,999/-","This is my 3rd iPhone after iPhone 4S and iPhone 6S Plus.Being an utter working middle class guy, I don't switch my iPhones very often (my android phones barely lasted me 9 months though). I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it.Pros:- I got this phone for INR 69,999/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser.Cons:- The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later.- The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly.- Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box."
Ktron,2018-10-11, Space Grey , 256GB,True,5.0,Amazing beast(iPhone X 256 GB) for discount!!,"Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k. Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine.iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an ""IN"" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!!Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcommâ€™s chips has always been better than Intelâ€™s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage. So recommend having a case around it (preferably a transparent one so that the beauty of the original phone can still be enjoyed!)2) I have to say that battery life is average - a shade better than iPhone 8.3) Additional touch id support would have been better as an alternative unlocking optionWill come up with a detailed review soon in a couple of weeks."
Amazon Customer,2018-11-02, Space Grey , 64GB,True,1.0,Battery charging is very bad in my new iPhone X,I ordered new iPhone X grey on Amazon sale.

Abha Tiwari,2018-11-08, Space Grey , 64GB,True,5.0,The Best Device ! All i need is my Iphone.,"What a pleasure to own iphonex. I bought it when it was launched. Checking today ...the price has dropped a 10K. Almost a year since my last upgrade. I do not compare phones. And I DO NOT compare them with Iphones. I think it is undeserving. Just saying. The camera is major on this one. The portrait mode is ace! I have the space grey in 64Gb and that's pretty much all the technical details I need. I'm one of those fortunate buyers who has the dough to spend on Apple products while residing in India so I don't really need to sit and debate with other people about why an X,Y,Z brand is better. I think Apple IS the best. Looks, functionality and everything. It does test the depth of your pockets and I think that's the only mark that there is and therefore it doesn't need comparing with other nondescript ones. I have never had any complains with any of my iphones in the past. This is my fourth upgrade. As a girl , it fulfils on the following categories - Good looks, Good looks & Good Looks. So grateful to Apple. So grateful to Amazon & so grateful to the seller. Thank you."

Gaurav bisht,2018-12-02, Silver , 64GB,True,5.0,Iphone X - Better phone to buy in 2018 & 2019,I was confused between Iphone X and Iphone XR but finally made decision to buy iphone X due to its best in class design and components. I have used Iphone 5s in past still it works like a charm. I bought this device during amazon sale at 62K and it is really value for money deal.Its been 2 month didn't face any type of issues & moreover having - 120 Hz touch-sensing capability the screen is really buttery smooth. Go for Iphone X blindly as Iphone XS & XR are just copy of X with few advancements that doesn't make much difference.
Ron Mukherjee,2018-10-25, Silver , 64GB,True,1.0,Received a phone with scratch on screen,Never noticed but received the product with a very light scratch on screen.
Ashish Gupta,2018-10-12, Silver , 256GB,True,4.0,Awesome phone with small disappointments,"The phone is simply awesome- The display, the smoothness, the feel in the hand is so premium.But what really annoys is lack of Fast charger and its cable is Cheap quality. Pricing is always an issue with apple. But the phone is really awesome. Accessories are on cheaper side quality wise.Needs protection to the most as any breakage will cost you a huge amount.One thing more- The packaging of the phone was pathetic. Didn't expect this from amazon. Cheap quality packing."

Jay Sangani,2018-11-12, Silver , 256GB,True,5.0,Thank you Amazon for the amazing deal,"Found the perfect deal during the Great Indian Festival. I thought the deal was too good to be true and was expecting a cancellation of order from the seller. But the day I received the order was epic. The phone is simply superb. Everything about the phone is perfect....hey what do expect from an Apple product. Good battery life, durable with screen protector and case and screen quality is excellent. Thank you Amazon"
Gaurav Gautam,2018-11-09, Space Grey , 64GB,True,5.0,Well it's Apple,This pjone is lit. I gifted it to my sister cause i am not huge on iOS but this one certainly impressed me. After just 20 minutes of exposure i learnt all the gestures and found myself doing them on my V20. Its expensive yes but it feels like it was meant for thos price tag.Well done Apple.PS I didn't like the front camera. Everything else is impressive.
Rajeev Seth,2019-01-14, Silver , 64GB,True,1.0,Iphone x,"Received the box intact.After unboxing the phone, i found the volume button sticky( non functional) and voice quality of the speaker was not upto mark.I approached b2x for the problem same day i received the phone.B2x replaced the phone in 7 days.Thanks to b2x for the same.But i wasnt expecting this kind of product from amazon."
Sushant S.,2018-12-12, Space Grey , 64GB,True,2.0,Genuine review by heart,"The battery life was better than previous iphones but can't take the competition from other phone available in the market it gives you one day(15 hrs approx) backup with moderate usage, it catches scratch very easily specially on its metal rim, screen was awesome, sound is also superb, camera is not upto mark, too much heating issues after upgrading ios 12.1.Not a value for money. Too much expensive."
Amit Pratap Singh,2018-11-04, Silver , 64GB,True,5.0,Good experience.,"I had an iphone 6s, i wanted to upgrade it so i thought to give it a try and i think it was a good idea. Screen is large and the notch. I love it."
KUNAL DOGRA,2019-01-16, Silver , 64GB,True,5.0,Great just great,"This is my first iphone i was a long time android user but after using this iphone my views have been completely changed for androids after using ios or iphone i have realised that iphone is  much better than android in terms of display,camera,speed the iphone works seamless i mean the speed is very goodThe battery is okay if you  dont play games the battery will run for a whole day in a single charge2-The camera is mind  blowing3- the phone processor speed is greatCons1- the battery drains fast when you play games or if you keep bright display light then also battery will not be able to keep it for a whole day"

Milind Ahuja,2018-11-27, Silver , 64GB,True,5.0,Worth the purchase,"My first ever iphone and this much expensive purchase from Amazon and i was literally doubtful if i should purchase this online. Now its been almost 1 month that i am using this (thanks amazon for the wonderful delivery and the seller Appario retail pvt ltd for building the trust) and trust me its worth every penny. I got an authentic product with earphones, charger and a connector, you can check it as well on imei24 and official apple website. It feels so premium in hands and very handy as compared to other latest phones. Yes i agree its very expensive but its worth it. I was a android user till now and i wanted a change so i decided for iphone X and i think i will be an apple user for life now lol. It will take you some time to explore the features as it is much different from Android but it's fun. Face recognition works like a charm and overall it is really fast so 3GB works same like the 8 GB RAM on the other phones.. Camera take the real and natural pictures with beautiful colors without fake filters and all. It is much more secure than the android phones. Battery backup might not be the best but its not that bad as well.Overall i would say its a great product and if you are bored from using andorid and need a change and also if you love luxury, Go for this.First month went really good, let's see how will be experience in coming months, i might change my review accordingly then lol."
Manish Mittal,2019-02-02, Silver , 64GB,True,1.0,"Defective software. Doesn't load appstore.. Very sorry support by B2X Apple service center, Delhi","Very annoying purchase. There is no appstore on the device. Took it to Apple service center in Ansal plaza Delhi, the day after purchase. They couldn't fix it. They were supposed to call me with a fix but they never did.  The apple call center in Gujarat didnt have the Ansal plaza store number. My email to the service center went unanswered ( i have proof). Today i went to Apple service center again and they loaded appstore but when I brought home and refreshed the OS, it's gone again.  Unfortunately, now realized the return window is over. Can't believe I am stuck with a INR 75,000 lemon. This cant be the way to support such an expensive product by Apple in India. Atrocious.. I am hoping Apple folks read this and do the right thing by replacing my device or refunding the money!!"
Syed,2018-10-29, Space Grey , 256GB,True,5.0,Truly a phone which will leave an impression,"Apple has always been a coin with 2 sides, it has loyal followers who will swear by it and it has loyal critics who will feed of it. Now coming to the iPhone X. I will be speaking only about the phone and itâ€™s features and not compare with other models.Pros-- Its  truly a beautiful phone. The notch in the top is something I feel u will want to have once u start using it.- the build quality is amazing. Itâ€™s a premium phone from the get go. Once u open the box, itâ€™s like opening a Pandoraâ€™s box, something truly befitting a flagship.(of course itâ€™s an year old now)- the screen resolution is just crisp and jaw dropping. Unlike its predecessors, the screen is gorgeous. Colours are spot on, the True Tone display needs some time to get used to but later thereâ€™s no turning back to the normal mode. The colours, no matter the time of the day, sunlight , no light, moonlight, tube light or what ever, always great.-the camera is very good being a dual camera and all and the pictures are pretty good, although I am not a avid mobile photographer.-the size of the phone is just right. At least for me it seems a good fit. Although sometimes 2 hands are required for some tasks but overall one handed most of the time.- Face ID- this is where it gets tricky. The phone unlocks with Face ID or a passcode. Now I have tried this feature with a beard , dim lighting , night times and many possible scenarios, and I must say , itâ€™s good. Although itâ€™s takes a few milliseconds more in low lighting, but over all good. (PS NOTE- there is no finger print unlock !!!!!!!)- The phone is truly fast. Multitasking, heavy gaming, anything is like a walk in the park for the phone. Itâ€™s truly a beast with it processing speed. Doesnâ€™t warm up even when doing multiple tasks or playing PUBG. You have to understand that apple uses its RAM in a different way, so 3gb RAM may seem little on paper but donâ€™t let numbers fool you.Cons-- battery life - now the battery life for the average usage is good but for gaming and heavy usage I feel is a bit disappointing. Could have been better, but hey, thatâ€™s what power banks are there for.- headphone jack- this is truly frustrating sometimes!!!! I mean come on!!!!! Who will manufacture Bose or sony  or beats headphones with a lighting cable!!!!!!!! U will have to carry the connector all the time or leave it attached to ur headphones all the time to avoid forgetting them in a hurry.These are just a few points I have noticed after using the phone for sometime, will update if I feel anything is needed."
