Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine.iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an \"IN\" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!!Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm\u2019s chips has always been better than Intel\u2019s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage.

I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it.Pros:- I got this phone for INR 69,999\/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser.Cons:- The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later.- The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly.- Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.","title_processed":"amazing deal inr 69999","desc_processed":"3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","metaCorpus_processed":"showrobda space grey 64 gb amazing deal inr 69999 3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","Sentiment":1.0},{"Reviewer":"Ktron","DateOfReview":"2018-10-11","Colour":"Space Grey","Size":"256GB","VerifiedPurchase":true,"Rating":5.0,"ReviewTitle":"Amazing beast(iPhone X 256 GB) for discount!!","ReviewDescription":"Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k.

Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine.iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an \"IN\" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!!Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm\u2019s chips has always been better than Intel\u2019s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage.

I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it.Pros:- I got this phone for INR 69,999\/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser.Cons:- The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later.- The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly.- Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.","title_processed":"amazing deal inr 69999","desc_processed":"3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","metaCorpus_processed":"showrobda space grey 64 gb amazing deal inr 69999 3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","Sentiment":1.0},{"Reviewer":"Ktron","DateOfReview":"2018-10-11","Colour":"Space Grey","Size":"256GB","VerifiedPurchase":true,"Rating":5.0,"ReviewTitle":"Amazing beast(iPhone X 256 GB) for discount!!","ReviewDescription":"Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k.

Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine.iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an \"IN\" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!!Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm\u2019s chips has always been better than Intel\u2019s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage.

I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it.Pros:- I got this phone for INR 69,999\/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser.Cons:- The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later.- The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly.- Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.","title_processed":"amazing deal inr 69999","desc_processed":"3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","metaCorpus_processed":"showrobda space grey 64 gb amazing deal inr 69999 3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","Sentiment":1.0},{"Reviewer":"Ktron","DateOfReview":"2018-10-11","Colour":"Space Grey","Size":"256GB","VerifiedPurchase":true,"Rating":5.0,"ReviewTitle":"Amazing beast(iPhone X 256 GB) for discount!!","ReviewDescription":"Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k.

Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine.iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an \"IN\" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!!Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm\u2019s chips has always been better than Intel\u2019s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage.

I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it.Pros:- I got this phone for INR 69,999\/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser.Cons:- The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later.- The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly.- Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.","title_processed":"amazing deal inr 69999","desc_processed":"3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","metaCorpus_processed":"showrobda space grey 64 gb amazing deal inr 69999 3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","Sentiment":1.0},{"Reviewer":"Ktron","DateOfReview":"2018-10-11","Colour":"Space Grey","Size":"256GB","VerifiedPurchase":true,"Rating":5.0,"ReviewTitle":"Amazing beast(iPhone X 256 GB) for discount!!","ReviewDescription":"Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k.

Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine.iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an \"IN\" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!!Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm\u2019s chips has always been better than Intel\u2019s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage.

I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it.Pros:- I got this phone for INR 69,999\/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser.Cons:- The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later.- The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly.- Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.","title_processed":"amazing deal inr 69999","desc_processed":"3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","metaCorpus_processed":"showrobda space grey 64 gb amazing deal inr 69999 3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","Sentiment":1.0},{"Reviewer":"Ktron","DateOfReview":"2018-10-11","Colour":"Space Grey","Size":"256GB","VerifiedPurchase":true,"Rating":5.0,"ReviewTitle":"Amazing beast(iPhone X 256 GB) for discount!!","ReviewDescription":"Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k.

Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine.iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an \"IN\" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!!Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm\u2019s chips has always been better than Intel\u2019s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage.

I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it.Pros:- I got this phone for INR 69,999\/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser.Cons:- The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later.- The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly.- Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.","title_processed":"amazing deal inr 69999","desc_processed":"3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","metaCorpus_processed":"showrobda space grey 64 gb amazing deal inr 69999 3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","Sentiment":1.0},{"Reviewer":"Ktron","DateOfReview":"2018-10-11","Colour":"Space Grey","Size":"256GB","VerifiedPurchase":true,"Rating":5.0,"ReviewTitle":"Amazing beast(iPhone X 256 GB) for discount!!","ReviewDescription":"Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k.

Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine.iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an \"IN\" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!!Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm\u2019s chips has always been better than Intel\u2019s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage.

I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it.Pros:- I got this phone for INR 69,999\/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser.Cons:- The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later.- The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly.- Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.","title_processed":"amazing deal inr 69999","desc_processed":"3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","metaCorpus_processed":"showrobda space grey 64 gb amazing deal inr 69999 3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","Sentiment":1.0},{"Reviewer":"Ktron","DateOfReview":"2018-10-11","Colour":"Space Grey","Size":"256GB","VerifiedPurchase":true,"Rating":5.0,"ReviewTitle":"Amazing beast(iPhone X 256 GB) for discount!!","ReviewDescription":"Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k.

Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine.iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an \"IN\" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!!Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm\u2019s chips has always been better than Intel\u2019s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage.

I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it.Pros:- I got this phone for INR 69,999\/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser.Cons:- The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later.- The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly.- Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.","title_processed":"amazing deal inr 69999","desc_processed":"3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","metaCorpus_processed":"showrobda space grey 64 gb amazing deal inr 69999 3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","Sentiment":1.0},{"Reviewer":"Ktron","DateOfReview":"2018-10-11","Colour":"Space Grey","Size":"256GB","VerifiedPurchase":true,"Rating":5.0,"ReviewTitle":"Amazing beast(iPhone X 256 GB) for discount!!","ReviewDescription":"Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k.

Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine.iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an \"IN\" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!!Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm\u2019s chips has always been better than Intel\u2019s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage.

I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it.Pros:- I got this phone for INR 69,999\/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser.Cons:- The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later.- The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly.- Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.","title_processed":"amazing deal inr 69999","desc_processed":"3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","metaCorpus_processed":"showrobda space grey 64 gb amazing deal inr 69999 3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","Sentiment":1.0},{"Reviewer":"Ktron","DateOfReview":"2018-10-11","Colour":"Space Grey","Size":"256GB","VerifiedPurchase":true,"Rating":5.0,"ReviewTitle":"Amazing beast(iPhone X 256 GB) for discount!!","ReviewDescription":"Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k.

Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine.iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an \"IN\" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!!Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm\u2019s chips has always been better than Intel\u2019s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage.

I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it.Pros:- I got this phone for INR 69,999\/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser.Cons:- The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later.- The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly.- Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.","title_processed":"amazing deal inr 69999","desc_processed":"3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","metaCorpus_processed":"showrobda space grey 64 gb amazing deal inr 69999 3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","Sentiment":1.0},{"Reviewer":"Ktron","DateOfReview":"2018-10-11","Colour":"Space Grey","Size":"256GB","VerifiedPurchase":true,"Rating":5.0,"ReviewTitle":"Amazing beast(iPhone X 256 GB) for discount!!","ReviewDescription":"Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k.

Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine.iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an \"IN\" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!!Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm\u2019s chips has always been better than Intel\u2019s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage.

I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it.Pros:- I got this phone for INR 69,999\/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser.Cons:- The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later.- The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly.- Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.","title_processed":"amazing deal inr 69999","desc_processed":"3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","metaCorpus_processed":"showrobda space grey 64 gb amazing deal inr 69999 3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","Sentiment":1.0},{"Reviewer":"Ktron","DateOfReview":"2018-10-11","Colour":"Space Grey","Size":"256GB","VerifiedPurchase":true,"Rating":5.0,"ReviewTitle":"Amazing beast(iPhone X 256 GB) for discount!!","ReviewDescription":"Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k.

Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine.iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an \"IN\" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!!Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm\u2019s chips has always been better than Intel\u2019s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage.

I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it.Pros:- I got this phone for INR 69,999\/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser.Cons:- The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later.- The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly.- Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.","title_processed":"amazing deal inr 69999","desc_processed":"3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","metaCorpus_processed":"showrobda space grey 64 gb amazing deal inr 69999 3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","Sentiment":1.0},{"Reviewer":"Ktron","DateOfReview":"2018-10-11","Colour":"Space Grey","Size":"256GB","VerifiedPurchase":true,"Rating":5.0,"ReviewTitle":"Amazing beast(iPhone X 256 GB) for discount!!","ReviewDescription":"Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k.

Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine.iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an \"IN\" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!!Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm\u2019s chips has always been better than Intel\u2019s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage.

I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it.Pros:- I got this phone for INR 69,999\/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser.Cons:- The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later.- The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly.- Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.","title_processed":"amazing deal inr 69999","desc_processed":"3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","metaCorpus_processed":"showrobda space grey 64 gb amazing deal inr 69999 3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","Sentiment":1.0},{"Reviewer":"Ktron","DateOfReview":"2018-10-11","Colour":"Space Grey","Size":"256GB","VerifiedPurchase":true,"Rating":5.0,"ReviewTitle":"Amazing beast(iPhone X 256 GB) for discount!!","ReviewDescription":"Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k.

Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine.iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an \"IN\" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!!Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm\u2019s chips has always been better than Intel\u2019s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage.

I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it.Pros:- I got this phone for INR 69,999\/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser.Cons:- The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later.- The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly.- Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.","title_processed":"amazing deal inr 69999","desc_processed":"3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","metaCorpus_processed":"showrobda space grey 64 gb amazing deal inr 69999 3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","Sentiment":1.0},{"Reviewer":"Ktron","DateOfReview":"2018-10-11","Colour":"Space Grey","Size":"256GB","VerifiedPurchase":true,"Rating":5.0,"ReviewTitle":"Amazing beast(iPhone X 256 GB) for discount!!","ReviewDescription":"Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k.

Additionally received cash back of Rs.1000. On delivery, I checked at imei24 and apple site  (checkcoverage) for authenticity and warranty of the product. I was satisfied as the product was 100% genuine.iPhone is buttery smooth and the full screen is an awesome experience. Personally, I love the notch as it gives character to the phone. No matter how much you hate the design it seems this is quite an \"IN\" thing now for almost all phone manufacturers have started copying Apple. So all you detractors out there of Apple and the notch - take a chill pill :)!!Pros:1) A11 Bionic Processor is blazing fast and coupled with 3GB ram you will never have any issues with any of the heavy duty tasks you throw at it2) Screen resolution (Super retina HD) and the contrast ratio makes the viewing experience breathtaking3) Got the A1865 model ( iPhone X A1865 uses the Qualcomm MDM9655 Snapdragon X16 LTE modem while the iPhone X A1901 has the Intel XMM 7480 modem) which is better than the A1901 model as A1865 covers more cellular bands (GSM and CDMA networks and frequencies) and the performance of Qualcomm\u2019s chips has always been better than Intel\u2019s. LTE speeds and cellular receptions in case of weak signals also are a shade better than A1901.Cons:1) All glass body makes this susceptible to breakage.

I do consider them extremely expensive, and I wouldn't go for one, unless I felt it was worth the money I was paying for it.Pros:- I got this phone for INR 69,999\/- from Amazon. With exchange offer, it cost me a little over 60K. For the price (and that price only), this makes it worth the buy.- It may not be the latest and greatest, but compared to iPhone XR, this is a much better package overall. Considering the XR is now priced higher than X. XS is only marginally better, and didn't feel it was worth the extra 30K.- Even after a year of being on the market, this phone is an absolute beast in terms of performance, especially after iOS 12.- The Camera is a beauty. You can't compare with DSLRs, but it is right up there with OnePlus and Google phones.- Looks exactly like the XS, and doesn't even have the S badging. So no one will be the wiser.Cons:- The delivery was a bit of a hassle. I had opted for One Day Delivery, at my work address. The agent reached at 7:30 in the morning, when I was obviously not at work. He did say he will come later in the afternoon. However, received the phone a day later.- The phone is extremely slippery. Invest in a good case, front screen protector and a rear glass protector- Such expensive phones should come with 128GB of storage as base, instead of 64GB. If you record 4K videos, it will eat up your storage really quickly.- Videos get heavily cropped when watching in full screen mode. If you have the money, go for XS Max.- The battery isn't the best. Takes over two hours to fully charge from 5% to 100% even with the iPad charger. With moderate usage, you can get 8 hours barely.- With the price of the phone, should have at least come with the fast charger in the box.","title_processed":"amazing deal inr 69999","desc_processed":"3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","metaCorpus_processed":"showrobda space grey 64 gb amazing deal inr 69999 3rd iphone iphone 4s iphone 6s plus utter work middle class guy not switch iphone often android phone barely last 9 month though consider extremely expensive would not go one unless feel worth money pay pros get phone inr 69999 amazon exchange offer cost little 60k price price make worth buy may not late great compare iphone xr much good package overall consider xr price high x xs marginally good not feel worth extra 30k even year market phone absolute beast term performance especially ios 12 camera beauty not compare dslr right oneplus google phone look exactly like xs not even badging no one wise cons delivery bit hassle opt one day delivery work address agent reach 730 morning obviously not work say come later afternoon however receive phone day later phone extremely slippery invest good case front screen protector rear glass protector expensive phone come 128 gb storage base instead 64 gb record 4k video eat storage really quickly video get heavily crop watch full screen mode money go xs max battery not good take two hour fully charge 5 100 even ipad charger moderate usage get 8 hour barely price phone least come fast charger box","Sentiment":1.0},{"Reviewer":"Ktron","DateOfReview":"2018-10-11","Colour":"Space Grey","Size":"256GB","VerifiedPurchase":true,"Rating":5.0,"ReviewTitle":"Amazing beast(iPhone X 256 GB) for discount!!","ReviewDescription":"Thanks to Appario Retail Private Ltd, I got this 256 GB beast during amazon great Indian sale for under 80k.

All i need is my Iphone.","ReviewDescription":"What a pleasure to own iphonex. I bought it when it was launched. Checking today ...the price has dropped a 10K. Almost a year since my last upgrade. I do not compare phones. And I DO NOT compare them with Iphones. I think it is undeserving. Just saying. The camera is major on this one. The portrait mode is ace! I have the space grey in 64Gb and that's pretty much all the technical details I need. I'm one of those fortunate buyers who has the dough to spend on Apple products while residing in India so I don't really need to sit and debate with other people about why an X,Y,Z brand is better. I think Apple IS the best. Looks, functionality and everything. It does test the depth of your pockets and I think that's the only mark that there is and therefore it doesn't need comparing with other nondescript ones. I have never had any complains with any of my iphones in the past. This is my fourth upgrade. As a girl , it fulfils on the following categories - Good looks, Good looks & Good Looks. So grateful to Apple. So grateful to Amazon & so grateful to the seller. Thank you.","title_processed":"good device need iphone","desc_processed":"pleasure iphonex buy launch check today price drop 10k almost year since last upgrade not compare phone not compare iphone think undeserv say camera major one portrait mode ace space grey 64 gb pretty much technical detail need one fortunate buyer dough spend apple product reside india not really need sit debate people x z brand good think apple good look functionality everything test depth pocket think mark therefore not need compare nondescript one never complain iphone past fourth upgrade girl fulfil follow category good look good look good look grateful apple grateful amazon grateful seller thank","metaCorpus_processed":"abha tiwari space grey 64 gb good device need iphone pleasure iphonex buy launch check today price drop 10k almost year since last upgrade not compare phone not compare iphone think undeserv say camera major one portrait mode ace space grey 64 gb pretty much technical detail need one fortunate buyer dough spend apple product reside india not really need sit debate people x z brand good think apple good look functionality everything test depth pocket think mark therefore not need compare nondescript one never complain iphone past fourth upgrade girl fulfil follow category good look good look good look grateful apple grateful amazon grateful seller thank","Sentiment":1.0},{"Reviewer":"Prabhandh Reddy","DateOfReview":"2018-10-27","Colour":"Space Grey","Size":"64GB","VerifiedPurchase":true,"Rating":1.0,"ReviewTitle":"Bad product (BUT GOOD SERVICE FROM AMAZON)\ud83d\ude0a","ReviewDescription":"Got a defective phone .... phone receiver not working very often problem started on the next day of delivery .... have to restart the phone evry time....Have contacted apple support they suggested me some setting and resets.... but that helped only for 1day....evn after software update also same issue, receiver not working(cannot hear the other person on call)I have gone through websites and i found thousands of people will defective speakers n receivers on their iphone xAMAZON IS GIVING ME A REPLACEMENT FOR THE PHONETHANK YOU AMAZON","title_processed":"bad product good service amazon","desc_processed":"get defective phone phone receiver not work often problem start next day delivery restart phone evry time contact apple support suggest setting reset help 1day evn software update also issue receiver not work not hear person call go website find thousand people defective speaker n receiver iphone xamazon give replacement phonethank amazon","metaCorpus_processed":"prabhandh reddy space grey 64 gb bad product good service amazon get defective phone phone receiver not work often problem start next day delivery restart phone evry time contact apple support suggest setting reset help 1day evn software update also issue receiver not work not hear person call go website find thousand people defective speaker n receiver iphone xamazon give replacement phonethank amazon","Sentiment":-1.0},{"Reviewer":"Deepak","DateOfReview":"2018-10-25","Colour":"Space Grey","Size":"64GB","VerifiedPurchase":true,"Rating":1.0,"ReviewTitle":"Iphone was not in working condition","ReviewDescription":"I had a worst experience in purchasing Iphone X.
